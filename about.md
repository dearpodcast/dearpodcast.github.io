Dear is a collection of audio poscards, short vingettes, 'found sound,' and more. 

In 2017, Davis Land and Brie Ripley began exchanging letters -- audio letters -- on the feed. Initially a project to keep ourselves making oddball radio, the kind of stuff we couldn't make at our jobs as public radio reporters, Dear became a beast in its own right, where bits and pieces of our lives manifested themselves as short audio vignettes. 

Now, it's mostly Davis who posts to the feed. He occasionally brings on other radio makers who are doing creative and weird audio. Contact Davis <a class="link underline" href="http://davisland.info">here</a> if you want to place a piece of yours on Dear.
