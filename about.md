Dear is a podcast wherein Brie Ripley and Davis Land exchange letters -- audio letters.

Initially a project to keep ourselves making oddball radio, the kind of stuff we can't make at our jobs as public radio reporters, Dear has become a beast in its own right, where bits and pieces of our lives manifest themselves as short audio vignettes. 

We have more episodes and a new approach coming in the near future, so stay tuned!
